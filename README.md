# bosch-spark

## Context :

This project uses the data of the bosch Kaggle challenge 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/bosch-production-line-performance/

Bosch records data at every step along its assembly lines.

In this competition, Bosch is challenging Kagglers to predict internal 
failures using thousands of measurements and tests made for each component 
along the assembly line. 
This would enable Bosch to bring quality products at lower costs to the end user.


## What's the goal of this Java project ?

We want to know for each component in what lines and stations it is been manufactured.


manufacturing processes.
